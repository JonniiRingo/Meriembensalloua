Phase 1: The Foundation (Database)
Time: 30 Minutes Goal: Create the storage for appointments.

Update schema.prisma:

Add a Booking model.

Fields: id, startDateTime, endDateTime, customerName, customerEmail, status (PENDING, CONFIRMED), productId (Relation to Product).

Migration:

Run npx prisma db push to sync.

Phase 2: The "Brain" (Server Logic)
Time: 2 Hours Goal: Prevent double-booking without complex logic.

Hardcode Availability (MVP):

Define "Business Hours" in a constant (e.g., M-F, 9am–5pm PST).

Server Action: getAvailableSlots(date, productId):

Input: A specific Date.

Logic: Generate all 9am–5pm slots -> Query DB for existing bookings on that date -> Filter out the busy ones -> Return the free slots.

Server Action: createBooking(data):

Logic: Re-check availability (race condition safety) -> Create Record -> Trigger Email.

Phase 3: The Interface (Frontend)
Time: 3 Hours Goal: A clean UI using your existing Shadcn components.

Calendar Component:

Use <Calendar /> (Shadcn) to let user pick a date.

Disable weekends and past dates.

Time Slot Grid:

When a date is picked, fire getAvailableSlots.

Render valid times as <Button variant="outline" />.

Guest Form:

When a time is clicked, show a Dialog/Modal.

Fields: Name, Email, Notes.

"Confirm Booking" button fires createBooking.

Phase 4: Integration
Time: 1 Hour Goal: Connect the new system to your Product Pages.

Product Page Update:

Go to app/(root)/product/[slug]/page.tsx.

Replace the static "Add to Cart" or "Buy" button with a "Book Session" button that opens your new Calendar component.

Email Notification:
